This project is based on "Elite Battle Robot" (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/elite-battle-robot-02b9587184b746178c85fe9ced67ccd7) by NicolasCalaba (https://sketchfab.com/NicolasCalaba) licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

This project also uses the FreeGLUT library instead of WinAPI for cross-platform support, the project itself should already have the FreeGLUT package installed, but if the package is missing, you can install the package following the instruction here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/freeglut.3.2.2.v140
